# Insights

## Sales

- The USA office has the most sales in 2013 and 2014, but in 2015 it was surpassed by France. Overall, the USA office is the most profitable one, while the performance of Japan's office has declined steeply.
- Classic cars are the most popular products and also provide the greater stream of income. Other relevant product lines are trucks and buses, and vintage cars.
-  Even though the office in Paris is not the most relevant, two of the most sellers, Gerard Hernandez and Pamela Castillo, are based there.

## Purchases

- The US is the most relevant market, followed by Spain and France.
- The US has the most customers. Several Western European countries, such as Germany, France and Spain also contribute a significant amount of clients.
- The total revenue grew in 2014 and fell sharply in 2015. However, the proportion of revenue of each product line remained the same. This could be caused a general depression of the market.
